# This file contains the CODEOWNERS of hep-ce. It is used to determine 
# required reviews on Pull Requests. Each line is a file pattern followed 
# by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @MJC598 and @ddbaptiste will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @MJC598 @ddbaptiste

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies R or C++ files, only @the specified teams and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository.
